						<h2 align="center">What is it?</h2>
						<p>When was the last time you read a book? It's been a while hasn't it? Or maybe it hasn't, either way a book is not a common form of media in the current generation. It is quite unfortunate actually,  but there is a reason. Books are too long and inconvenient. However we solved this by making stories shorter and shorter, eventually creating short stories, but they're typically not as professional, common or as high quality compared to books, which aren't common to begin with. We at Aphro believe that we can revolutionize the short story and literature industry.</p>

						<h2 align="center">Progress?</h2>
						<p>Other than minor polishing and bug fixes, the main functionality component of the site is completed. We want to wait the site out until we are 100% sure it is safe and ready for users to use. New functionality is literally added every day and more efficient procedures are replaced by the old, less efficient operations. The main obstacle with The Story Project will definitely be funding since funding will not only help us host the site and put it online but help us hire skilled professionals to take the website even further. </p>
